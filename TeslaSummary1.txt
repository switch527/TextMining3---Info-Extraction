Company Description
Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Palo Alto, CA, Tesla Motors designs, manufactures and sells high performance electric vehicles (EV) and electric powertrain technology including battery packs. Launched in 2008, Tesla's Roadster was the first commercial EV that complied with federal standards with ~ 1,650 vehicles sold through 1Q11. Tesla's next-generation EV called the Model S is set to launch in mid-2012 with extended range  features. The company also sells battery packs to Daimler for use in their smart and A-class EVs and recently agreed to jointly develop batteries for Toyota's RAV4 model.
TSLA: THE STORY CHANGES; SELL
Capital raise to meet rising capital needs. As expected Tesla announced it would seek to sell 5.3M shares (~6.1M with over allotment) in a secondary offering. Concurrently, CEO Elon Musk will invest ~$40M in a private placement of 1.5M shares and Daimler will add another ~$15-17M from
~577K shares (645K shares with over allotment), which could raise as much as ~$243M at yesterday’s closing price of $29.48. A successful raise with over allotment would dilute the shares by ~8% but with negative earnings the dilution lowers our forecasted net loss for 2011.
The story changes. As we discussed before the 1Q11 earnings call, we predicted the secondary would come  sooner rather than late 2H11 as Tesla’s strategy has shifted towards selling more mass market vehicle (Model X) likely  at a lower price point. Tesla hopes to introduce a prototype by YE11. We believe Tesla recognizes the limitations of selling one model aimed a niche luxury market and smartly took advantage of market strength to tap the capital markets for its growing capital needs.
Raising capex forecasts for 2011-2013. We have increased our forecasted capex for 2011-2013, by $50M to
$250M in 2011 and by $120M in 2012 to $325M and by
$130M to $340M in 2013. We are still not convinced Tesla has sufficient capital to fund development of both cars into mass production but we too would take the money if it was available. We continue to believe the secondary is not just  for the Model X development but for higher than expected production and design costs along with greater future marketing spend. We still expect the Model S could be delayed 3-6 months but the “story” has shifted to diminish that potential negative.
Annual meeting on June 1 certain to be positive; SELL into strength. We believe the upcoming annual shareholder’s meeting on 6/1 could provide a near-term boost as Tesla is a stock investors (especially retail) want to believe will be successful – its “green”, the auto prototypes are sexy and Mr. Musk is a successful entrepreneur. However, whispered comparisons of Tesla to Apple are absurdly premature. The new “story” pits Tesla directly against the other auto OEMs that can count on far superior supplier leverage, balance sheets, brands, reach and automobile knowledge. The niche luxury “story” is gone. We would use the anticipated strength from next week’s meeting to exit long positions and/or initiate short positions.
